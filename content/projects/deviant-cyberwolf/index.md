Deviant Cyberwolf is about trying to identify the hidden identity of each player is, specifically if a player is one of a small number of "Cyberwolves". The wolf human question make situate I think perfectly capture this narrative.

The tagline "Online and out of time" is a homage to the classic low budget taglines of 80s horror and science-fiction but also alludes to the nature of the game which is in essence a race against time.
