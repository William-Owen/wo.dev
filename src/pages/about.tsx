				<h2>About</h2>

				<p>I was born and work in England, very happily married and a life long non-smoker. In no particular order, and among the many things I love are coffee, jazz, video games, wine, reading and fashion and philosophy.</p>

				<p>I play the guitar.</p>

				<p>My wife is Japanese and I love Japan and Japanese culture (私の日本語力は悪いです). </p>
